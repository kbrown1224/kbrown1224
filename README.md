ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

My name is Kip. I am a senior data scientist, web developer, and just a general tech enthusiast. I love to tinker with new, shiny things! I don't have a whole lot of work up here yet, but I'm working on it!

If you want to learn more about me in the meantime, [head on over to my portfolio.](https://kip-brown.dev)
